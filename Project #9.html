    <div class="h3">Project #9, Media Rental Manager (Due Monday, May 10, 11:30 pm)</div>


    <div class="h4">Objectives</div>
    <p>To practice design, inheritance, ArrayList and javadoc.</p>

    <p><strong>
        You must implement this project by yourself. DO NOT POST ANY INFORMATION
        in Piazza regarding the classes/interfaces you are planning to use in your design.
        If you post any information you will be violating academic integrity rules.
    </strong>
    </p>

    <p>This project have been used in previous semesters. Using any implementation
        you might found online or from another student represents an academic integrity
        violation.
    </p>

    <div class="h4">Overview</div>
    <p>
        For this project you will implement a simplified version of a system
        that allows people to rent movies and music albums (similar to Netflix)
        and receive them via mail. For this project you will define all the classes
        needed (yes it is your design :)).
    </p>

    <div class="h4">Grading</div>
    <ul>
        <li>(60%) Public Tests</li>
        <li>(10%) Release Tests</li>
        <li>(15%) Design that includes at least three classes / interfaces (not including MediaRentalManager)</li>
        <li>(10%) ArrayList Requirement</li>
        <li>(5%) Javadoc</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="h4">Code Distribution</div>
    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2021/cmsc131-01XX/projects/zipFiles/MediaRentalManager.zip">MediaRentalManager.zip</a>.
        Download it and import it as you have imported our class examples.
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A package named <b>mediaRentalManager </b> - In this package you will provide
            the implementation for the system. We have provided an interface(
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2021/cmsc131-01XX/projects/MediaRentalManager/doc/mediaRentalManager/MediaRentalManagerInt.html">MediaRentalManagerInt</a>
            ) that specifies the functionality your system is expected to implement. The
            complete javadoc for the project can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2021/cmsc131-01XX/projects/MediaRentalManager/doc/index.html">javadoc</a>.
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>tests </b> - Includes the public tests and
            the shell file for your student tests.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <div class="h4">Specifications</div>
    <p>
        You must define a class named <strong>MediaRentalManager</strong> (we did not provide it) that
        implements the MediaRentalManagerInt interface functionality. You must define classes
        that support the functionality specified by the interface. The following specifications
        are associated with the project:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You should study the public tests and the output (files with .txt extension)
            to familiarize yourself with the expected system functionality.
        </li>

        <li>Define a class named <strong>MediaRentalManager</strong>. Feel free to add
            any instance variables you understand are needed or any private methods. Do not
            add any public methods (beyond the ones specified in the MediaRentalManagerInt interface).
        </li>

        <li>
            The media rental system keeps track of customers and media (movies and music albums).
            A customer has a name, address, a plan and two lists (queues). One queue represent
            the media the customer is interested in receiving and the second one represents the
            media already received (rented) by the customer. There are two plans a customer
            can have: UNLIMITED and LIMITED. UNLIMITED allows a customer to receive as many
            media as they want; LIMITED restricts the media to a default value of 2 (this value
            can be change via a manager method).
            A movie has a title, a number of copies available and a rating (e.g., "PG"). An album
            has a title, number of copies available, an artist and the songs that are part
            of the album.
        </li>

        <li>You must define and use at least three classes / interfaces (not including MediaRentalManager) as part of
            your design. <strong>These classes must support the functionality
                of the system, otherwise you will not receive any credit.</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
            The database for your system needs to be represented using two ArrayList objects.
            One ArrayList will represent the customers present in the database; the second will
            represent the media (movies and albums). This is the ArrayList requirement
            provided in the <b>Grading</b> section.
        </li>

        <li>You must define javadoc for the classes you implement. You do not need to provide
            javadoc comments for the MediaRentalManager class. Notice you do not need to run
            the javadoc utility.
        </li>

        <li>
            Regarding the searchMedia method: the songs parameter represents a substring
            (fragment) or the full list of songs associated with the album. If the full list
            is provided, you can assume commas will be part of the string. <strong>Hint:</strong> you may
            want to consider using the indexOf method of the String class.
        </li>

        <li>Feel free to use Collections.sort to sort your data.
        </li>

        <li>Although you are not require to write student tests you are encourage to do so.
        </li>

        <li>
            Not all the details associated with the project can be fully specified in this
            description. The sooner you start working on the project the sooner you will
            be able to address any doubts you may have.
        </li>

        Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so you understand
        what is permissible in our programming projects. We want to remind you that we check your
        project against other students' projects and any case of academic dishonesty will be referred
        to the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">University's Office of Student Conduct</a>.
